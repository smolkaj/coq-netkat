NFA -> DFA (Powerset construction, "Deduplication")
==================================
* define DFAs, acceptance of DFAs, language of DFAs
* give construction NFA -> DFA
* prove forall A : NFA, nfa_lang(A) = dfa_lang(DFA(A))


DFA -> DFA ("Localization")
===========================
* define language equivalence modulo field
* define syntax sugar s1.p1->s2.p2 := dup; sw=s1; pt=p1; sw<-s2; pt<-p2; dup
* show that for any program p = in; g with A := dfa(p), there exists a
  dfa A' with only two states s.t.
    dfa_lang(A') == dfa_lang(A) (modulo some field f)
  - Assumptions:
    + g may contain links, but no Dups or switch modifications
    + in is a predicate with the property t; in = 0 (where t is the union
      of all links mentioned in g)
    + the field f does not appear in program p
  - Intuition:
    The two states of A' represent the input and output buffers, respectively.
    Any packet is either entering or leaving a switch (intermediate states
    are not observed). Going from an input buffer to an output buffer, a packet
    is processed by a switch; going from an output buffer to an input
    buffer, a packet is processed by the topology.
  - Construction of A':
    + replace all links s1.p1->s2.p2 in p with
        sw=s1; pt=p1; dup; t; dup; sw=s2; pt=p2
      to obtain p'.
    + show p' === p axiomatically.
    + conclude A := A(p') == A(p).
    + Cleary A can be two-colored (i.e. A is bipartite). States are
      alternatingly input buffer and output buffer states, with the start state
      being an input buffer state.
    + All output buffer states q have outdegree = 1, i.e. have a unique sucessor
      suc(q).
    + Modify all input buffer states q of A s.t.
      * they only match on packets with f==q
      * they satisfy 
          transition q pk pk' q' -> pk'.f==suc(q').
      * construction:
          A' := 
            {| dfa_s := dfa_s A; 
               accept q pk pk' = pk.f = q && @accept A q pk pk'
               trans q pk pk' q' = pk.f = q && @trans A q pk pk' q' 
                                   && pk'.f = suc(q')
            |}
      * finally, all input buffer states can be collapsed and all output buffer
        states can be collapsed, unioning transition and acceptance relations.
